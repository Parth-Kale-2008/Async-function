This project demonstrates basic Promise creation, chaining (then) and error handling (catch) in JavaScript.

It is useful for beginners learning asynchronous programming and understanding how Promise resolution and rejection flow works.

The function saveToDb() simulates saving data to a database using a Promise.
It logs the data and then intentionally triggers an error to show how .catch() works.
